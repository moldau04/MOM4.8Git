                <Value>  Customer shall report any condition of the elevator and/or escalator equipment in need of service and/or repair as quickly as possible so Madden can rectify solutions as commercially practical.  We shall not be required to install new attachments or perform improvements required by code on your customers existing equipment.  Monitoring equipment owned by Madden and placed on elevator, equipment shall remain the property of Madden and Madden will be permitted to enter customer’s premises during normal working hours to remove such equipment at the expiration and/or termination of this service agreement.  Failure to permit removal will result in customer reimbursing Madden for the full replacement cost of such equipment, including associated labor, supervision and overhead.  Customer will provide Madden all necessary wiring diagrams, manuals, instructions, handbooks and proprietary software or hardware needed for Madden to properly maintain customers’ equipment.  Customer agrees to provide a weatherproof and adequately ventilated machine room between temperatures of 50 degrees and 90 degrees Fahrenheit for elevator and/or escalator equipment to operate properly along with sufficient lighting for Madden to maintain equipment safely.  Madden or any of its affiliates, officers, shareholders, agents, independent contractors, directors or employees shall not be responsible or liable to customer or any third party for any of the following: delay due to accident, injury, acts of god, explosion, fire, power failure, lightening, storms, windstorms, earthquakes, flood, riot, civil commotion, natural or public catastrophe, warfare, malicious mischief, negligence, theft, vandalism, overloading of equipment, labor disputes, strikes, lockouts defects in material, design and/or workmanship resulting from the original installation or with respect to any of the above, any other cause which is unavoidable or beyond Maddens direct reasonable control.  If repairs or replacements are necessary due to any of the above items, customer agrees to pay for such work at Maddens standard billing rates.  Madden warrants the quality of its workmanship and materials for all repairs performed in this service agreement for 90 days from the date of completion.  Customer shall not permit others to make changes, adjustments, additions, alterations, repairs or replacements to the equipment while it is under this service agreement.  Customer shall accept Maddens judgment for any corrective work required to maintain customer’s equipment in safe operating order in accordance with applicable laws.  Customer agree to pay, at Maddens standard billing rates (inclusive all applicable sales taxes) the following: calls or repairs performed outside this service agreement as mutually agreed; and any damage occurred during testing to the equipment or building will be the sole responsibility of the customer because testing places much greater stress on the elevator and/or escalator equipment than during normal conditions. This service agreement shall immediately become void, upon written notice to Madden Elevator, if repair of critical safety equipment is needed and not approved by customer.  These recommendations may be from Governmental Authority having Jurisdiction, or from Insurance Companies, or from Madden.  We shall be granted free access to the elevator and/or escalator equipment at any time during normal business hour or as may be needed that is mutually agreed upon by both parties.  Customer, upon recommendations made by Madden, shall be responsible for supervising the use of the elevators and/ or escalator equipment and shall provide necessary personnel, signage and other controls and precautions necessary to insure the safe operation of customer’s equipment.  Customer shall properly instruct it’s invitees, guests and/or passengers in the proper use and care of your equipment and customer will remove from service any elevator and/or escalator if, at any time, it becomes unsafe or operates in such a way that it might cause, or likely cause, injury to someone or damage to the equipment.  Customer agrees to notify Madden in writing immediately (no later than 24 hours except upon weekend &amp; holidays) of any accident, alteration or change of equipment regarding the elevator and/or escalators under this service agreement.  Customer agrees to notify Madden in writing of any change in equipment ownership of this service agreement 30 days prior to ownership change.  Failure to notify Madden will result in customer (and/or any successor-in-interest) remaining responsible for payments and charges set forth in this service agreement.  Customer can cancel any time with a 30 day written notice.  There will be no further penalties or fees for early termination.  Customer must pay any and all outstanding obligation to Madden Elevator Company prior to the end of such 30 day notice period.  Nonpayment of monies owed over 30 days will result in interest at maximum rate allowed by law and service agreement may be canceled by Madden Elevator for lack of payment. Customer shall at all times be solely liable for the operation of the elevator and/or escalator and customer shall indemnify, protect, defend and save harmless Madden and its shareholders, officers, directors, employees, independent contractors and/or affiliates from and any all liabilities, losses and claims of any kind or nature imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against Madden Elevator or its affiliates arising out of the operation of the equipment except those directly due to and proximately caused by, the sole negligence of Madden Elevator.  Madden shall not be liable for any type of damages (including but not limited to incidental, consequential and/or special damages) caused by the failure and/or defect in any component and/or system of the original equipment manufacturer (it be expressly understood that customers sole recourse shall directly be against such original manufacturer without Madden being a named party to any legal proceedings).   With respect to Madden’s only negligence, Madden’s liability shall be limited only to the action direct damages incurred (and exclusive of any incidental, consequential and/or special damages) up to, but not exceeding, the limits of its insurance policies, to the extent as may be applicable.
